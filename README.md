i followed that youtube tutorial to make a simple turtle race game in python. 
To change the program, I redisgned it to follow an object orientated design with proper error handling.
An OOD is completely unnecessary for this program, and in my opinion is an inferior approach to the original code. 
Despite this i decided to redo the program in this way to practise my python skills and to practise working on other peoples
code that i do not initially understand.
